## 4th Sem Summer Internship ðŸ¥‡

### ðŸŒŸ Webmint Infotech Summer Internship 2024 ðŸŒŸ
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Summer Internship 2024! This project highlights the work completed during my internship at Webmint Infotech, offering practical insights and hands-on experience gained throughout the program.

## ðŸš€ Introduction ðŸš€
I officially began my internship at Webmint Infotech, an innovative tech company renowned for its cutting-edge solutions and dynamic work environment. Under the guidance of company founder Mitesh Lathia and HR Kruti Patel, I gained valuable experience in web development using WordPress and other complementary tools and technologies.

## My Internship Experience with WordPress Technology

### Creating My Event Management Website

#### Local Development with XAMPP
I created my event management website using WordPress technology, which allows us to create websites without extensive coding knowledge in a short time. I explored two methods to develop this website: locally and on a live server.

Initially, I used XAMPP to create the website locally. XAMPP is one of the widely used cross-platform web servers, helping developers to create and test their programs on a local web server. It includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl, making it a powerful tool for local development. However, I faced several issues starting MySQL with XAMPP, which can be a common problem due to port conflicts or incorrect configurations.

#### Simplifying Local Development with Localwp
Due to the MySQL issues with XAMPP, I switched to using Localwp, a tool designed to simplify the process of spinning up a local WordPress server on a Mac, PC, or Linux for local WordPress development. Localwp provides a more streamlined and user-friendly environment for WordPress development. It offers features like one-click WordPress installation, easy site management, and a built-in SSL certificate. I found Localwp to be very efficient and user-friendly, significantly reducing setup time and allowing me to focus more on development.

#### Hosting with InfinityFree
After developing the website locally, I hosted it on a live server using InfinityFree, a website that offers free hosting and domains. InfinityFree provides unlimited disk space, unlimited bandwidth, and a free subdomain, making it an excellent choice for beginners and small projects. This platform provided excellent hosting services, and my website can be viewed at [prit.rf.gd](http://prit.rf.gd). Hosting the website live allowed me to understand the deployment process and the importance of choosing a reliable hosting service.

### Why I Prefer WordPress Over MERN
I find WordPress technology better than MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) because it is simpler and easier to learn, making it accessible to everyone, even beginners. WordPress offers a user-friendly interface, a vast repository of plugins and themes, and strong community support. While MERN is powerful and flexible, WordPress provides a quicker and more straightforward solution for creating websites, especially for those with limited coding experience.

### Other Tools and Technologies

#### HTTrack
I also worked with HTTrack, a web application that allows us to easily get the frontend code of any website. This is a great application for beginners to practice and understand web development. HTTrack mirrors websites by downloading their files and structure, making it easier to analyze and learn from existing websites. I used HTTrack to extract and modify the frontend code of a school management website, enhancing my skills in HTML and CSS.

#### Figma and Theme Forest
Additionally, I used Figma for designing logos and themes and explored various themes on Theme Forest. Figma is a powerful design tool that allows for real-time collaboration, making it perfect for team projects. Theme Forest offers a vast collection of pre-designed themes, which can significantly speed up the development process. These tools greatly enhanced the visual appeal of my projects and provided a professional touch to my designs.
